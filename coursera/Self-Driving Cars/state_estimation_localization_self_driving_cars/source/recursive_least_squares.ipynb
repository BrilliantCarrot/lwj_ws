    "Given your experience with batch least squares (where all measurements are processed at once), you now decide convert your batch solution to a recursive one for added flexibility. Recall that you have the following data:\n",

    "| Current (A) | Voltage (V) |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 0.2         | 1.23        |\n",
    "| 0.3         | 1.38        |\n",
    "| 0.4         | 2.06        |\n",

    "This time, you intend to fit a linear model that includes an offset term, $V = RI + b$. If Ohm's law ($V = RI$) holds, you expect this offset to be very near to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the recursive least squares formulation, you must have a prior estimate of the resistance and its associated uncertainty (otherwise, you won't know how to weigh the information you receive from a new measurement). You choose to set the initial parameters under the assumption that your prior estimate of the resistance, $R = 4$, is not very good. Also, since you are fairly sure that Ohm's law ($V = RI$) does, in fact, hold, you feel that it is safe to assume with high confidence that the offset term $b$ is close to zero. After some thought, you choose to intialize the recursive estimator as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{R} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(4, 9.0),~~\\hat{b} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Your initial guess is that $\\hat{R}$ follows a Gaussian or normal distribution (recall that you do not know the exact value of $R$, so it must be considered as a random variable) with a mean of $4~\\Omega$ and a standard deviation of $3~ \\Omega$ (i.e., a variance of $9~\\Omega^{2}$). Similarly, your intial guess is that $\\hat{b}$ should also follow a normal distribution with a mean of $0~V$ and a variance of $0.2~V^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data again in hand, your goals are to: \n",
    "1. Fit a line to the data that includes an offset term (i.e., determine the parameters $R$ and $b$ for $y = Rx + b$) by using the method of recursive least squares. \n",
    "2. Reflect on the differences between the batch and recursive least squares solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that the current values are known exactly, and that the voltage measurements are corrupted by additive, independent and identitically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of $0.15~V$ (i.e., a variance of $0.0225 ~ V^2$). You may also assume that your initial estimates for $\\hat{R}$ and $\\hat{b}$ are uncorelated (i.e., the off-diagonal elements of the $2 \\times 2$ covariance matrix are zero). \n",
