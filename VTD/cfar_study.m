%% 1. CFAR Detection Using Automatic Threshold Factor
% we show how to use Phased Array System Toolbox to perform a cell averaging CFAR detection. 
% For simplicity and without losing any generality, we still assume that the noise is white Gaussian. 
% This enables the comparison between the CFAR and classical detection theory.
% We can instantiate a CFAR detector using the following command:

cfar = phased.CFARDetector('NumTrainingCells',20,'NumGuardCells',2);

% In this detector we use 20 training cells and 2 guard cells in total. This means that there are 10 training cells 
% and 1 guard cell on each side of the CUT. As mentioned above, if we assume that the signal is 
% from a square law detector with no pulse integration, the threshold can be calculated based on 
% the number of training cells and the desired probability of false alarm. Assuming the desired false alarm rate is 
% 0.001, we can configure the CFAR detector as follows so that this calculation can be carried out.

exp_pfa = 1e-3;     % 100,000 번의 몬테 카를로 결과로 바뀌게 되는 값
cfar.ThresholdFactor = 'Auto';
cfar.ProbabilityFalseAlarm = exp_pfa;

% We now simulate the input data. Since the focus is to show that the CFAR detector can keep the false alarm rate 
% under a certain value, we just simulate the noise samples in those cells. Here are the settings:
% The data sequence is 23 samples long, and the CUT is cell 12. 
% This leaves 10 training cells and 1 guard cell on each side of the CUT.
% The false alarm rate is calculated using 100 thousand Monte Carlo trials.

rs = RandStream('mt19937ar','Seed',2010);
npower = db2pow(-10);  % Assume 10dB SNR ratio, 음수일 때 잡음 전력이 신호 전력보다 크다는 뜻

Ntrials = 1e5;  % 100,000번의몬테 카를로 시뮬레이션
Ncells = 23;
CUTIdx = 12;    % CUT cell의 인덱스

% Noise samples after a square law detector
% 복소수 가우시안 노이즈 샘플을 생성
% 시뮬레이션에서 잡음을 모델링하거나 랜덤 신호를 생성할 때 사용
rsamp = randn(rs,Ncells,Ntrials)+1i*randn(rs,Ncells,Ntrials);   % 실수부분과 허수부분을 합쳐서 생성  
x = abs(sqrt(npower/2)*rsamp).^2;   % 노이즈 샘플의 전력

% To perform the detection, pass the data through the detector. In this example, 
% there is only one CUT, so the output is a logical vector containing the detection result for all the trials. 
% If the result is true, it means that a target is present in the corresponding trial. 
% In our example, all detections are false alarms because we are only passing in noise. 
% The resulting false alarm rate can then be calculated based on the number of false alarms & the number of trials.

x_detected = cfar(x,CUTIdx);
act_pfa = sum(x_detected)/Ntrials;

% The result shows that the resulting probability of false alarm is below 0.001, just as we specified.

%% 2. CFAR Detection Using Custom Threshold Factor

% As explained in the earlier part of this example, there are only a few cases in which the CFAR detector
% can automatically compute the appropriate threshold factor. For example, using the previous scenario, 
% if we employ a 10-pulses noncoherent integration before the data goes into the detector, 
% the automatic threshold can no longer provide the desired false alarm rate.

npower = db2pow(-10);  % Assume 10dB SNR ratio
xn = 0;
for m = 1:10
    rsamp = randn(rs,Ncells,Ntrials)+1i*randn(rs,Ncells,Ntrials);
    xn = xn + abs(sqrt(npower/2)*rsamp).^2;   % noncoherent integration
end
x_detected = cfar(xn,CUTIdx);
act_pfa = sum(x_detected)/Ntrials;

%% 3. CFAR Detection Threshold

% CFAR detection occurs when the input signal level in a cell exceeds the threshold level. 
% The threshold level for each cell depends on the threshold factor and the noise power in that derived from 
% training cells. To maintain a constant false alarm rate, the detection threshold will increase or 
% decrease in proportion to the noise power in the training cells. Configure the CFAR detector to output 
% the threshold used for each detection using the ThresholdOutputPort property. 
% Use an automatic threshold factor and 200 training cells.

release(cfar);
cfar.ThresholdOutputPort = true;
cfar.ThresholdFactor = 'Auto';
cfar.NumTrainingCells = 200;

% Next, create a square-law input signal with increasing noise power.

rs = RandStream('mt19937ar','Seed',2010);
Npoints = 1e4;
rsamp = randn(rs,Npoints,1)+1i*randn(rs,Npoints,1);
ramp = linspace(1,10,Npoints)';
xRamp = abs(sqrt(npower*ramp./2).*rsamp).^2;

% Compute detections and thresholds for all cells in the signal.

[x_detected,th] = cfar(xRamp,1:length(xRamp));

% Next, compare the CFAR threshold to the input signal.

plot(1:length(xRamp),xRamp,1:length(xRamp),th,...
  find(x_detected),xRamp(x_detected),'o')
legend('Signal','Threshold','Detections','Location','Northwest')
xlabel('Time Index')
ylabel('Level')

% Here, the threshold increases with the noise power of the signal to maintain the constant false alarm rate. 
% Detections occur where the signal level exceeds the threshold.

%% 4. Comparison Between CFAR and Classical Neyman-Pearson Detector

% In this section, we compare the performance of a CFAR detector with the classical detection theory 
% using the Neyman-Pearson principle. Returning to the first example and assuming the true noise power is known, 
% the theoretical threshold can be calculated as

T_ideal = npower*db2pow(npwgnthresh(exp_pfa));

% The false alarm rate of the classical Neyman-Pearson detector can be calculated using this theoretical threshold.

act_Pfa_np = sum(x(CUTIdx,:)>T_ideal)/Ntrials;

% Because we know the noise power, classical detection theory also produces the desired false alarm rate. 
% The false alarm rate achieved by the CFAR detector is similar.

release(cfar);
cfar.ThresholdOutputPort = false;
cfar.NumTrainingCells = 20;
x_detected = cfar(x,CUTIdx);
act_pfa = sum(x_detected)/Ntrials;

% Next, assume that both detectors are deployed to the field and that the noise power is 1 dB more than expected.
% In this case, if we use the theoretical threshold, the resulting probability of false alarm is four times 
% more than what we desire.

npower = db2pow(-9);  % Assume 9dB SNR ratio
rsamp = randn(rs,Ncells,Ntrials)+1i*randn(rs,Ncells,Ntrials);
x = abs(sqrt(npower/2)*rsamp).^2;   
act_Pfa_np = sum(x(CUTIdx,:)>T_ideal)/Ntrials;

% On the contrary, the CFAR detector's performance is not affected.

x_detected = cfar(x,CUTIdx);
act_pfa = sum(x_detected)/Ntrials;

% Hence, the CFAR detector is robust to noise power uncertainty and better suited to field applications.
% Finally, use a CFAR detection in the presence of colored noise. 
% We first apply the classical detection threshold to the data.

npower = db2pow(-10);
fcoeff = maxflat(10,'sym',0.2);
x = abs(sqrt(npower/2)*filter(fcoeff,1,rsamp)).^2;   % colored noise
act_Pfa_np = sum(x(CUTIdx,:)>T_ideal)/Ntrials;

% Note that the resulting false alarm rate cannot meet the requirement. However, using the CFAR detector 
% with a custom threshold factor, we can obtain the desired false alarm rate.

release(cfar);
cfar.ThresholdFactor = 'Custom';
cfar.CustomThresholdFactor = 12.85;
x_detected = cfar(x,CUTIdx);
act_pfa = sum(x_detected)/Ntrials;

%% 5. CFAR Detection for Range-Doppler Images

% In the previous sections, the noise estimate was computed from training cells leading and lagging the CUT 
% in a single dimension. We can also perform CFAR detection on images. Cells correspond to pixels in the images, 
% and guard cells and training cells are placed in bands around the CUT. The detection threshold is computed 
% from cells in the rectangular training band around the CUT.

% https://kr.mathworks.com/help/examples/phased/win64/CFARDetectionExample_03.png

% In the figure above, the guard band size is [2 2] and the training band size is [4 3]. 
% The size indices refer to the number of cells on each side of the CUT in the row and columns dimensions, 
% respectively. The guard band size can also be defined as 2, 
% since the size is the same along row and column dimensions.
% Next, create a two-dimensional CFAR detector. Use a probability of false alarm of 1e-5 and 
% specify a guard band size of 5 cells and a training band size of 10 cells.

cfar2D = phased.CFARDetector2D('GuardBandSize',5,'TrainingBandSize',10,...
  'ProbabilityFalseAlarm',1e-5);

% Next, load and plot a range-doppler image. The image includes returns from two stationary targets and 
% one target moving away from the radar.

[resp,rngGrid,dopGrid] = helperRangeDoppler;

% https://kr.mathworks.com/help/examples/phased/win64/CFARDetectionExample_04.png

% Use CFAR to search the range-Doppler space for objects, and plot a map of the detections. 
% Search from -10 to 10 kHz and from 1000 to 4000 m. First, define the cells under test for this region.

[~,rangeIndx] = min(abs(rngGrid-[1000 4000]));
[~,dopplerIndx] = min(abs(dopGrid-[-1e4 1e4]));
[columnInds,rowInds] = meshgrid(dopplerIndx(1):dopplerIndx(2),...
  rangeIndx(1):rangeIndx(2));
CUTIdx = [rowInds(:) columnInds(:)]';

% Compute a detection result for each cell under test. Each pixel in the search region is a cell in this example.
% Plot a map of the detection results for the range-Doppler image.

detections = cfar2D(resp,CUTIdx);
helperDetectionsMap(resp,rngGrid,dopGrid,rangeIndx,dopplerIndx,detections)

% 2D CA-CFAR의 경우 오경보 확률(7.4e-04 = 0.00074)
test_pfa = sum(detections)/Ntrials

% https://kr.mathworks.com/help/examples/phased/win64/CFARDetectionExample_05.png

% The three objects are detected. A data cube of range-Doppler images over time can likewise be provided 
% as the input signal to cfar2D, and detections will be calculated in a single step.
